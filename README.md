<h1><strong>Coding Quiz Challenge</strong></h1>

<p>This app is series of questions that runs in a loop, where if you get the answers to be correct it moves to the next question, but if you get it wrong, it deducts 10 seconds from your time and than moves to the next question.

At the ends your max is what you have left out of the 90 seconds.

You can access the quiz [here](
